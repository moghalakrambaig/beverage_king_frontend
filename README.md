# Beverage King / Spirited Hub — Full Project README 🍹

> This README lives in the `beverage_king_frontend/` folder and documents **both** the frontend and the backend so you have a single place to start development and run the whole project.

---

## Project summary

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript SPA using Tailwind CSS and Radix/Shadcn UI components.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot app (Java 17) with data persistence (H2/MySQL/MongoDB support), CSV import, email (AWS SES), and authentication.

Both projects are developed in the same workspace and can be run independently or in containers.

---

## Quick start (local)

Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended 18+ / 20 LTS)
- npm
- Java 17
- Maven (or use `mvnw` / `mvnw.cmd` provided)

Frontend — run locally

```bash
cd beverage_king_frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend build (production)

```bash
npm run build
# built files end up in `dist/`
```

Backend — run locally

```bash
cd beverage_king_backend
# Linux / macOS
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# Windows
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Or build and run the packaged jar:

```bash
cd beverage_king_backend
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

---

## Docker (frontend)

The frontend contains a Dockerfile that builds the app and serves static files with nginx.

```bash
# from inside beverage_king_frontend/
docker build -t beverage-king-frontend:latest .
docker run -p 80:80 beverage-king-frontend:latest
```

Backend dockerization is not included by default but you can package the jar and create a simple `Dockerfile` that uses an OpenJDK image to run it.

---

## Environment variables

Frontend (Vite): use `.env` files at the project root or set env vars with `VITE_` prefix. Example variables you might want:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=...
```

Backend: uses `spring-dotenv` (so `.env`) + `application.properties`. Typical variables:

```
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=secret
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_REGION=...
MAIL_FROM=...
```

If you want, I can create `.env.example` files in both `beverage_king_frontend/` and `beverage_king_backend/` showing the recommended variable names.

## Tech stack — quick reference 🔧

**Frontend**
- Vite
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI + shadcn UI patterns
- React Router, React Query
- Supabase client, qrcode.react, xlsx, date-fns, lucide-react, etc.

**Backend**
- Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Data JPA, Spring Data MongoDB
- Spring Security, Spring Mail
- H2 (dev/runtime), MySQL connector (runtime), AWS SDK (SES)
- opencsv for CSV parsing, spring-dotenv for .env support
- Maven build

---

## Tests & Linting

- Backend tests: `./mvnw test` in `beverage_king_backend`.
- Frontend lint: `npm run lint` in `beverage_king_frontend`.

---

## Useful commands summary

- Start backend: `cd beverage_king_backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run`
- Start frontend: `cd beverage_king_frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
- Build frontend: `npm run build`
- Build frontend Docker image: `docker build -t beverage-king-frontend:latest .`

---

## Notes & next steps

- I can add `.env.example` files and a small `docker-compose.yml` to run both services together if you'd like. 
- Should we also add a `README.md` in the backend root with more backend-specific docs or keep single README in frontend? (You asked to keep both details in the frontend README — I kept it consolidated here.)

---

**If you want, I can now add `.env.example` files and a `docker-compose.yml` to run both services together — which would you prefer?**
